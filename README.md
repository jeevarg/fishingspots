Problem Statement

As a fishing enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for good fishing spots in and around my area. I have found few web 
sites / apps which does provide the spots but either you have to sign up or some of the spots are not revealed. 
FishingSpots website allows Users to browse the website for the spots as a guest without any sign-up's. They can also 
add new spots on to the website and rate the spots.
