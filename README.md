Fishing Spots repository is being built in order to complete the Enterprise Java Class course and also to present in front of potential future employers. 

### Problem Statement

As a fishing enthusiast, I am always on the lookout for good fishing spots in and around my area. I have found few web 
sites / apps which does provide the spots but either you have to sign up or some of the spots are not revealed. 
FishingSpots website allows Users to browse the website for all the spots as a guest without any sign-up's. However, Users have to sign-up to  add new spots, rate a spot, edit/delete their own spots and give ratings to a spot.
